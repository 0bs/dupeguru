"DemoPromptMsg" = "{name} is fairware, which means \"open source software developed with expectation of fair contributions from users\". It's a very interesting concept, but one year of fairware has shown that most people just want to know how much it costs and not be bothered with theories about intellectual property.\n\nSo I won't bother you and will be very straightforward: You can try {name} for free but you have to buy it in order to use it without limitations. In demo mode, {name} {limitation}.\n\nSo it's as simple as this. If you're curious about fairware, however, I encourage you to read more about it by clicking on the \"Fairware?\" button.";
