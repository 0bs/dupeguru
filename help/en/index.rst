    |appname| is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer. It can scan either filenames or contents. The filename scan features a fuzzy matching algorithm that can find duplicate filenames even when they are not exactly the same.

.. only:: edition_pe

    dupeGuru Picture Edition (PE for short) is a tool to find duplicate pictures on your computer. Not only can it find exact matches, but it can also find duplicates among pictures of different kind (PNG, JPG, GIF etc..) and quality.

Although dupeGuru can easily be used without documentation, reading this file will help you to master it. If you are looking for guidance for your first duplicate scan, you can take a look at the :doc:`Quick Start <quick_start>` section.

It is a good idea to keep |appname| updated. You can download the latest version on its `homepage`_.
