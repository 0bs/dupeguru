    \ will too! Ok, here is the list of Mp3 Filter version 2.00 godly features:\r\n\
    \r\n* **SPEED!!!!!!!!!!!!** Forget about what I said before. Previous versions\

    \ What took 1 minute take 3-5 seconds now, and the more files you have to compare\
    \ together, the better will be the files/time ratio will be!\r\n* Multi-list system.\
    \ It is now easier than ever to exchange lists with your friends and select songs!\r\
    \n* Cuter interface."
  version: '2.00'
- date: 2001-06-29
  description: There was some stability issues with the internal player I was using.
    Mp3 Filter is now using Winamp. Thus, all files playable by Winamp are now playable
    by Mp3 Filter. Fixed some minor bugs. Changed the way word exclusion system work.
    AND added a song selection system. Now you can select songs from your mp3 list
    and copy them to your hard drive without having to worry about where are these
    songs.
  version: '1.61'
- date: 2001-06-28
  description: 'The main theme of this update is efficiency. Mp3 Filter v1.53 was
    already pure speed, you will NOT believe this version''s one. 60% faster on ALL
    comparisons! Do not search for God anymore, you found Him and He even got an e-mail
    adress: cathedly@hotmail.com :P. Ok, to tell you the truth I did not make Mp3
    Filter 60 % faster, I made it 60% less slow. My previous algorithm wasn''t bad,
    but I thought about another one (this one) that has much better performances.
    ALSO: Created an option form. Changed the results display (Added some info along
    with the results (size,length,bitrate). Added a word excluding system. Also added
    a backup system (Instead of deleting it, you can now move your file to the Mp3
    Filter backup directory (Mp3 filter does not compare files in the backup directory).'
  version: '1.60'
- date: 2001-06-27
  description: Damnit, big update. Added the conditional file searching, file copying,
    and rethought the Mp3List system. That new Mp3List system is damn cool! It load
    instantly, even with HUGE lists, and it reduces the comparing time with list by
    30 godly % !!! You're not gonna believe it! This program is now PURE SPEED!
  version: '1.53'
- date: 2001-05-05
  description: Quite cool update too. This version now can check if new versions are
    available. I also grouped all options in the same menu. I moved the search function.
    This function is now a lot cooler. Instead of giving you a list of matching results,
    it shows you, in the Mp3 List Stats form, where the song is by positioning itself
    in the List Tree.
  version: '1.52'
- date: 2001-05-04
  description: Waa! I'm so happy! I implemented a poll system to Mp3 Filter! Now you
    can answer my questions directly on the program! I can't wait to see if you, people,
    will answer!
  version: '1.51'
- date: 2001-05-03
  description: 'MAJOR UPDATE. This one is quite cool :). You ever used the "Edit Mp3
    List" feature? I improved it a lot. Now, when you add a CD to your list, it not
    only saves the CD name, but it also saves the whole CD directory system. So when
    you use ''Edit Mp3 List'' now, you can browse your CDs as if you would browse
    anything. (There''s only one problem: you must REbuild your mp3 list to make it
    fit with v1.5)'
  version: '1.50'
- date: 2001-05-02
  description: Added an equalizer. This equalizer has been a good reason to add an
    INI file to the program to store changed parameters.
  version: '1.46'
- date: 2001-05-01
  description: Added a Banlist to the program. You write down a list of unwanted songs
    in your ban list and start a scan. This function will not compare as the rest
    does. If ALL words contained in a banlist line are in a filename, it will match.
  version: '1.45'
- date: 2001-04-30
  description: I made the Mp3 Filter window to minimize when it compares so it can
    do it faster (a LOT faster). I also modified the program so it checks the playlist
    integrity each time there's a file deleted after a comparison). There was a bug
    with the v1.43. When you had the ID3 Tag window up and you closed the program,
    it would crash. Fixed that.
  version: '1.44'
- date: 2001-04-29
  description: I noticed some days ago that people who had a good resolution but the
    option to enlarge the icons on, Mp3 Filter had some big problems to display its
    main form right. Since you cant resize the form without having the objects in
    to resize too, I had to fix it. I also implemented a MUCH faster file searching
    system. It takes less than 2 seconds to find all mp3 on my hard disk now.
  version: '1.43'
- date: 2001-04-09
  description: Added some fun and useful feats. First, I made a cute playlist right-click
    menu with Play File, Edit Tag, Locate, Remove from list and delete from disk.
    I also added a recursive function to add songs to the playlist (Why didn't I think
    about it before?? I have no clue...). I also made the Shuffle thing less.... random.
    (It builds a random list and play it, so before a song play again, all songs will
    be played (I added that feat some time after v1.41 release, but I didn't thought
    that it worth a version change, so I only announce it on 1.42))
  version: '1.42'
- date: 2001-04-08
  description: I can't avoid it. there is always some bugs after a major update. I
    didn't thought about the fact that it was possible to make a playlist with unplayable
    files :) fixed that.
  version: '1.41'
- date: 2001-04-07
  description: MAJOR UPDATE! You wanted a playlist. You got it in this version. Those
    big buttons were ugly? Made a cute standard menu. You didn't seem to want to buy
    that program. I gave up. Here is it. Freeware again.
  version: '1.40'
- date: 2001-03-16
  description: Made it possible to play files that are listed after a "Find all Mp3
    on this drive". It also tells what song is currently playing on the main title
    bar.
  version: '1.36'
- date: 2001-03-15
  description: Added a system icon. Wow! it almost looks like winamp!
  version: '1.35'
- date: 2001-03-14
  description: Added music progress bar and made the music playing continuous.
  version: '1.34'
- date: 2001-03-13
  description: Added mass renaming functions.
  version: '1.33'
- date: 2001-03-12
  description: Fixed some bugs with those useful function :) (and made the program
    shareware)
  version: '1.32'
- date: 2001-03-11
  description: Added some useful functions.
  version: '1.31'
- date: 2001-03-10
  description: MAJOR CHANGE. yeah! I scrapped those radio buttons, and extended the
    "recurse" function. Now, you only have 2 choices. Or you compare with your list,
    or you compare within the folder (and sub-folders). With that system, you can
    tell the program to just compare ALL mp3 in your hard drive. You just have to
    select your drive root, and press "Find dupe files in this folder" having "Recurse"
    checked.
  version: '1.30'
- date: 2001-03-09
  description: Added the Music Control panel. I just love it. do you?
  version: '1.23'
- date: 2001-03-08
  description: Fixed some inaccuracy with folder to folder comparison. (Will I be
    done fixing someday??) and made mp3 search slightly faster.
  version: '1.22'
- date: 2001-03-07
  description: Added Mp3 Player (Didn't know it was so easy to include in a program!
    I woulda done this before if I knew...) and ID3 Tag Editor. Hum, The Mp3 Player
    has some problems reading some mp3s... know that.
  version: '1.21'
- date: 2001-03-04
  description: When I removed the "find mp3 in my list" thing, some people told me
    it was useful. However, I still think that the old way to search mp3 was too messed
    up, so I just added a little textbox and a search button for quick search.
  version: '1.20'
- date: 2001-03-03
  description: Damnit! why didn't I see it? There was a bug with displaying the right
    filename on the result boxes with List comparing. The results were switched! Thus,
    deleting was impossible after a List compare. Corrected it in 1.18.
  version: '1.18'
- date: 2001-03-03
  description: "When I read Yippee review (www.yippee.net thanks for review), I tried\
    \ to somewhat improve it. What changed? This:\r\n\r\n* Compare engine is less\
    \ strict. if one word contains the other, it now match (now, \"Limp Bizkit\" and\
    \ \"Limp Bizkitt\" would match)\r\n* Removed some useless features to simplify\
    \ the interface. \"Save as...\" (why did I put this on???) and \"Find file in\
    \ my list\" (Easier to find a song with \"Edit List\")\r\n* Added some hints to\
    \ buttons and some explicative labels.\r\n*  \"List Stats\" changed to \"Edit\
    \ List\" so you don't have to \"hard change\" your mp3 list."
  version: '1.19'
- date: 2001-02-06
  description: I never thought that a software history would be useful for such a
    small program, but since Mp3 filter won't stop improving, I decided to start it.
    So 1.17 is the base version.
  version: '1.17'
